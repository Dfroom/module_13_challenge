The file was too big for a git push. The file can be viewed on my Google Drive with the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qqyKGRvIfPymIP4BmCMhb1rK3p79j3dd/view?usp=sharing

### Should have used Google Colab
I ran the neural network on my local machine. It took about a minute per epoch (50 epochs) to run the network.
I shoudl also explore the effect of more output neurons- when I have the time to run it again.


# Code 
I had to use Chat GPT4 to work out 3 lines of the "Step 1: Create a deep neural network by assigning the number of input features, the number of layers, and the number of neurons on each layer using Tensorflowâ€™s Keras" code. I marked these lines with "#Help sought when writing this code". I had Chat GPT4 walk me through what the functions were for and how they worked, as a refresher.

## Optimize the nueral network model
I ran out of time to attempt this step. I will complete it at a future date.
